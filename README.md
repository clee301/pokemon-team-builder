# Pokemon Team Builder

Pokemon Team Builder is a web application where the user is able to look up Pokemon and add them to build their team.

# Description

User will be able to look up a Pokemon, which will then populate the general information. Users are able to add up to 6 Pokemon in the team just like the games. An error alert will be activated if the user tries to add more than 6 Pokemon. The stat card will include the type and the base stats.
